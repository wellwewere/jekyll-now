This website is something I forget about, remember, delete and restart, and then forget again.

### More Information

As this site is hosted on Github, you'll probably surmise that I have an interest in computers. This is true, I'm GNU/Linux man ([Solus](https://solus-project.com/) is my distro of the moment) and hobbyist programmer. I have a keen interest in the sciences, particularly physics, evolutionary biology and genetics.
